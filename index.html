                        There are generally 3 types of reasons considered for the increased mobility of black southerners during the Great Migration.
                        Most prominent are the economic factors such as better wages and more diverse employment oppurtunities.
                        Then you have the natural factors such as floods and the boll weevil infestation.
                        Lastly the social factors such as education, racial violence, and prosecution.

                            <p>

                                Of the social issues that plauged black southerners the most common by far were the injustice in courts, lynchings, denial of suffrage, discrimination, and inequalities with things such as the jim crow laws.
                                During the Great Migration these social issues were largley considered economic issues by observers and as such they were essentially ignored or viewed as less important when it came to the issues surrounding the migration.
                                This however is far from the truth and violence had a much bigger part to play than believed by many at the time.

                                Although many at the time refused to acknowledge the issue and connection of racial violence to the great migration, research done showed that it indeed played a part.
                                A study conducted during World War I by Emmett J. Scott showed that both black and white migrants stated lynchings and racial violence were one of the most important reasons for their movement.
                                For many migrants the fear of crossing a potentially violent hate mob was enough for them to want to leave home.
                                Was this fear that these black southerners felt tangible or was it just inflated panic?

                            <p>
                                
                                Many at the time believed the latter but now with data we can investigate a bit further.
                                From 1882 to 1930 roughly 1,655 black southerners were victims of lynch mobs.
                                During that same period of time 1,299 black southerners were legally executed.
                                That accounts for roughly 90% of all the executions in the south during that period of time.
                                The high percentage of black victims very clearly shows the disproportionate number of black southerners executed.
                                When you consider the population of these states never even came close to 90% black, it starts to become apparent that something else must have been going on.

                        The executions and lynch mob killings were enough to create an atmosphere of fear in the south for black southerners.
                        In order to get a clear picture of how this racial violence effected migration we need to look at more specific examples.
                        There are a few instances we will look at that highlight the connection between the two so we can get a better idea of the types of violence that was taking place.
                        Based on them we can start to get a clear view of exactly what black southerners had going on their minds and how these types of incidents may have altered their future decisions.
                        The first example follows a series of lynching incidents that occurred in Georgia from 1915 to 1918 infamously known as the lynching rampage of 1918.
                        The second example is the notorious lynching of Anthony Crawford which took place in Abbeville, South Carolina in 1916.

                                Sparking from outrage over the murder of a notorious white plantation owner in the area named Hampton Smith, more than a dozen victims were killed lynched as a result.
                                One of the most recognized victims was an eight month pregnant women named Mary Turner.
                                Turner's husband one man in a two man group accused of killing the farmer, her husband was hung as a result.
                                The following day Turner who was grief stricken, began to speak out against the hanging of her husband the day before.
                                The white mob present was outraged at this and decided to make an example out of her.
                                First hand accounts from plantation owners in the direct vicinity around this whole event described the movement of black workers off of their plantations as a result of "lynching parties that had terrorized their negroes".
                                The nature of Marys killing is disturbing to say the least and its not hard to imagine it would make fellow black southerners in the area start considering the idea of leaving.

                                Anthony Crawford was a successful cotton farmer who owned over 400 acres of land.
                                Infact Crawford was so successful he was considered to be one of the richest men in the county at the time.
                                On October 21, 1916 Crawford stopped by a store to sell two loads of cotton and a load cotton seeds to a white business owner.
                                What started as a simple disagreement over the price of cottonseed quickly turned violent when a white employee of the business assaulted him on his way out.
                                After the incdident he was rounded up and considered the guitly party in the incident which ended with the wrongful conviction and fatal hanging and shooting of Crawford.
                                Shortly after the killing the citizens of Abbeville held a vote to close down all black owned businesses which only helped to fuel an exodus.
                                The brutal killing and actions of the hate mob resulted in an increased out-migration of blacks from around the Abbeville area.

                                According to Emmett J. Scott, these incidents and others like them are a large reason why the Great Migration movement gained such widespread traction.
                                These kind of horrific stories were in national headlines in the news, broadcasted over the radio, put on billboards and signs.
                                These all helped spread awarness surrounding ongoing racial violence in the country, the rural south, and ultimately the migration.
                                Whether it was the barber shop or grocery store, black southerners were now openly discussing the prospect of migrating amongst their community.
                                The dissemination of this information lead to more black southerners looking for answers and a way out.

                        After researching this topic and viewing data from a collection of sources, one thing remained in question for me. 
                        Why did the population of black southerners not see any noticable sharp decrease in the south if violence was the reason for people leaving?
                        To answer this we can look at the differences between rural areas versus urban areas.
                        Racial killings and lynchings historically were primarily unique to rural areas thus black southerners living in rural areas had a much higher risk of mob violence.
                        The increase in risk promoted the migration from rural to urban areas, not just to northern cities but southern ones too which helped to bolster the black population in the urban south.
                        Stoies Like those of Mary Turner and Anthony Crawford highlight the loss in population in a rural area due to violence.
                        The result was that some migrants did not leave the south, they meerly changed locations within it.
                        For a lot of migrants they simply wanted to move and live somewhere more urban, not to just go north.
                        The Great Migration was an urbanization movement, and one of the important factors was due to this violence in the rural south.
